# NLP Query Engine for Employee Data

**A natural language query system for employee databases, dynamically adapting to any schema and supporting both structured and unstructured data.**


## 📌 Overview

This project is a **full-stack web application** that allows users to:

- Connect to any employee database and **auto-discover its schema**.
- Upload and process **unstructured documents** (PDFs, CSVs, etc.).
- Query the data using **natural language** and get results from both structured and unstructured sources.
- Visualize the schema, track performance, and export results.

Built for the **Ekam Labs AI Engineering Assignment**, this solution is **schema-agnostic**, production-ready, and optimized for performance.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

- **Dynamic Schema Discovery**: Automatically detects tables, columns, and relationships.
- **Natural Language Query Processing**: Supports SQL, document search, and hybrid queries.
- **Document Processing**: Handles PDFs, DOCX, TXT, and CSV files with intelligent chunking.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching, connection pooling, and async operations.

### User Interface

- **Data Ingestion Panel**: Connect to databases and upload documents.
- **Query Interface**: Auto-suggestions, query history, and real-time results.
- **Results Display**: Tables for structured data, cards for documents.
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Response time, cache hit rate, and active connections.

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Data Ingestion

* **Connect to a Database** :

  * Enter your database connection string in the **Database Connector** panel.
  * Click **Test Connection** to auto-discover the schema.
* **Upload Documents** :

  * Drag and drop files (PDF, DOCX, CSV) into the  **Document Uploader** .
  * Monitor progress in real-time.

### 2. Query Data

* Enter a natural language query (e.g.,  *"Show me all Python developers in Engineering"* ).
* View results in **table format** (structured data) or **cards** (documents).
